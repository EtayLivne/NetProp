# Simplest type of run: single network, single prior and knockout sets. Will create output file named path_to_dir/run_1.json
- run_1:
    network: path_to_file
    prior_set: [1,2,3]
    knockout_set: [7]
    prior_set_confidence: 0.1
    output_dir: path_to_dir

# single network, but list of prior/knockout sets. number of each type of set must match! Note the "repeats" keyword.
- run_2:
    network: path_to_file
    prior_set_confidence: 0.9
    prior_sets:
      - {set: [1,2,3], confidence: 0.1}
      - {set: randomized, set_size: 10}
      - {set: [2,3,4]}
      - [3,4,5]

    knockout_sets:
      - {set: randomized, repeats: 2}
      - {set: [], repeats: 2}
    output_dir: path_to_dir

# no such field as an etc, actually. But this works just likes runs 1/2, except operation will repeat for each file in folder. An output subfolder will be created for each network
- run_3:
    networks_dir: path_to_dir
    etc: etc
